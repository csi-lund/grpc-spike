# grpc-spike

Aims:
Create a grpc spike bringing together several areas I would like to explore - GRPC, 
Basing architeture on this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/grpc

Create a node and other language grpc microservice and C# grpc aggeragator microservice.
These should use arm templates for azure infrastructure.
The microservices should be dockerized and runnable on Azure container instances due to limiation on http2 on app service hosting.
